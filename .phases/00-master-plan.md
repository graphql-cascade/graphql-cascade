# GraphQL Cascade: World Reference Master Plan

## Vision Statement

Transform graphql-cascade from a promising specification into **the definitive standard for GraphQL cache invalidation** - adopted by major frameworks, trusted in production at scale, and recognized as the authoritative solution.

## Current State Assessment

| Dimension | Current State | Target State |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Specification | Complete (17 docs) | Formal W3C-style spec |
| Server Impl | Python (production-ready) | Multi-language reference |
| Client Impl | Apollo, React Query (basic) | All major frameworks |
| Adoption | Pre-release | 10K+ GitHub stars |
| Community | None | Active ecosystem |
| Performance | Untested at scale | Benchmarked, proven |

## Axes of Analysis

Each axis represents a critical dimension that must be world-class for graphql-cascade to become the reference standard.

---

- RFC process for extensions
- Implementation verification program

---

### AXIS 2: Multi-Language Server Implementations
**Engineer Persona: Polyglot Systems Engineer**

Reference implementations in every major server-side language.

**Focus Areas:**
- TypeScript/Node.js reference implementation

- Java/Kotlin reference implementation
- Ruby reference implementation
- Framework integrations (NestJS, Spring, Rails, etc.)

---

### AXIS 3: Complete Client Ecosystem
**Engineer Persona: Frontend Framework Specialist**

First-class support for every major GraphQL client library.

**Focus Areas:**

- Cookbook (common patterns)

---

### AXIS 7: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Engineer Persona: QA Architect**

Build comprehensive testing that ensures correctness and prevents regressions.

**Focus Areas:**
- Conformance test suite (spec compliance)
- Property-based testing
- Mutation testing
- Integration test scenarios
- Cross-framework compatibility tests
- Chaos testing (failure scenarios)

---

### AXIS 8: Security & Production Hardening
**Engineer Persona: Security Engineer**

Enterprise-grade security and production reliability.

**Focus Areas:**
- Security audit and hardening

## Execution Strategy

### Phase A: Deep Analysis (Current)
For each axis, a specialized engineer analyzes:
1. Current state assessment
2. Gap analysis vs world-class standard
3. Prioritized action items
4. Estimated effort and dependencies
5. Success metrics

### Phase B: Implementation
Engineers execute their plans, with:
- Cross-axis coordination
- Incremental PRs and releases
- Continuous testing and validation
- Community feedback integration

### Phase C: Launch & Adoption
- v1.0 release with all axes addressed
- Launch campaign
- Framework partnerships
- Conference circuit
